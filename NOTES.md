# Notes and such idfk

Goals

- create a CLI (of GUI) that will analyze my music library 
- can standardize the naming of all my music files
    - <artists> - <title> (<artist> Remix?)
- should be able to ask the user to double check and potentially manually correct some changes
- Can move files around into their correct artist's directory
- maybe link to a true database of the original and fixed metadata?
- can read dynamic range of audio files to determine energy level?
- separate the DJ library from the Music library



## First steps

- be able to batch read all the filenames in a directory (recursively down?)
- can create a correct (for me) filename for more optimal searching
-
